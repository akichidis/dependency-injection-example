# Dependency injection example

This project demonstrates the a very simple dependency injection mechanism 
by loading a JAR library on the fly and try to create instances of classes of 
an external library. The external library `external-implementation-lib` implements the interfaces 
of the `dependency-example-api`. The Dependency Injection takes place on the `dependecy-example-service`.
